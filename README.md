# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains a Python script for time series analysis and forecasting of furniture sales using the ARIMA model. The main steps include data preprocessing, visualization, model selection using grid search, and generating forecasts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels

The script reads the 'Sample - Superstore.xlsx' dataset, extracts furniture sales data, and performs ARIMA modeling for time series forecasting. The results are visualized, and forecast accuracy metrics are displayed.

Feel free to customize the script for your own time series data analysis.
